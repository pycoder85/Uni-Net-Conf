# Uni-Net-Conf

Welcome to the Uni-Net-Conf Project

The aim of this project is to automate cli configuration with simple english for none network techies.
The 'input' file is a 'csv' file, from which it will be the only file that needs to be amended with commands from various vendors.

To run the script, just run the configbox.py script.

The file is in raw python for now. But will eventually be rendered in some sort of GUI. 

Thanks and Enjoy
